# digit-recogniser

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. In this competition, the goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images and experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.


In this project, a handwritten digit’s recognition system was implemented with the famous MNIST data set.
Handwritten digits recognition problem has been studied by researchers since 1998 with almost all the algorithms designed by then and even until now. The test error rate decreased from 12% in 1988 by linear classifier to 0.23% in 2012 by convolutional nets, and these days more and more data scientists and machine learning experts are trying to develop and validate unsupervised learning methods such as auto-encoder and deep learning model. Besides, there are also a Kaggle project based on MNIST, which is perfect resource to begin with.
